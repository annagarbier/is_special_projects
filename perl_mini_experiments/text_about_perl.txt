Excerpt from "The joy of Perl" (ANDREW LEONARD, 1998)

Larry Wall likes to call Perl a "humble" language. In his
soft-spoken voice, he describes Perl as if it were a meek,
obeisant servant, existing only to "let you bend it to your uses."
The legions of Perl hackers who swarm the Web are less modest:
Perl, they declare, is the indispensable duct tape, or glue,
that holds the entire Web together...

Wall and Perl are all about messy imperfection and fuzzy creativity.
After all, duct tape is valuable not because it offers a perfect
solution to your plumbing problems, but because it gets the job done.
